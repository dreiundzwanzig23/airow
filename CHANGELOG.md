# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Reframed the repository documentation from generic template wording to a
  rowing simulator bootstrap project and documented that the current sample
  code is temporary placeholder state.
- Added explicit workflow and contribution references to
  `docs/process/TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md` and `docs/ai/DECISIONS.md`.
- Marked `docs/process/ARCHITECTURE.md` as bootstrap placeholder
  documentation pending the first simulator architecture seeding task.
- Extended instruction coherence checks to treat
  `docs/process/TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md` as a core process artifact.
- Refreshed the template process model to the evolved generic workflow:
  - moved policy into a stronger top-level `AGENTS.md`,
  - added requirement drift metadata (`Change-Type`, `Needs-Review`,
    `Change-Note`) and lightweight drift-review docs,
  - introduced repo-local skills and AI-doc archive scaffolding,
  - added validation step logging with JSON summaries,
  - expanded `tracecheck.py` with aux-test support and stricter evidence rules,
  - added ADR archival and instruction coherence tooling,
  - updated README, contributing guidance, maintenance docs, and AI context
    templates to match the stricter workflow.
